* Due on 2/9/2022


## Description
* This project was a backend social network API using monogoDB and mongoose.  A user can be created and can have associated thoughts and additional friends (users).  User's information can be updated, created and deleted.  Thoughts can also be created, updated, and deleted.  The thoughts also have reactions associated to them.  Whenever a thought or reaction is added/changed/deleted, the user is also updated to reflect the changes.
